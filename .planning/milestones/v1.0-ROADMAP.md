# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-18
**Phases:** 1-3
**Total Plans:** 7

## Overview

Build a bill splitter that takes manual line item entry, assigns items to friends, and calculates each person's share with proportional tax/tip/fees. Phase 1 establishes the foundation with tested calculation logic, Phase 2 delivers the core UI for entry and assignment, and Phase 3 adds output polish and keyboard shortcuts.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Establish project structure, deployment pipeline, and validate core splitting logic through pure functions with comprehensive tests
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: CALC-01, CALC-02, CALC-03
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md - Project scaffolding (TypeScript, Bun, build config, GitHub deployment)
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md - Core split calculation functions with TDD

**Success Criteria:**
1. Project builds and runs with Bun (no npm)
2. Static site builds and deploys to tusharc.dev/split via GitHub
3. Pure function correctly calculates proportional tax/tip/fees based on each person's subtotal
4. Pure function correctly splits shared items evenly among assigned people
5. Pure function correctly computes final amount per person
6. All calculation functions have passing unit tests

### Phase 2: Core UI

**Goal**: Users can enter a bill, manage diners, and assign items to people with live calculation updates
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: ENTRY-01, ENTRY-02, ENTRY-03, ENTRY-04, ASSIGN-01, ASSIGN-02, ASSIGN-03, ASSIGN-04, FRIEND-01, FRIEND-02, FRIEND-03, UX-01
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md - State management, localStorage, and diner entry UI
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md - Dish entry with qty/price and bill totals validation
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md - Assignment chips, unassigned warnings, live Individual Shares

**Success Criteria:**
1. User can add, edit, and delete line items with name and amount
2. User can enter tax, tip, and fees as separate amounts
3. User can manage a preset list of friends (stored in localStorage) and add new ones
4. User can select which friends are participating in this bill
5. User can assign each item to one or more people, including an "everyone" shortcut
6. User can see which items are unassigned (visual indicator)
7. User can see running total vs expected total for sanity checking
8. UI works well on mobile devices (responsive layout)

### Phase 3: Polish

**Goal**: Enhanced output display with item breakdown, clipboard export, and keyboard-only data entry flow
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: OUT-01, OUT-02, UX-02
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md - Expandable share breakdown and Copy Summary button
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md - Keyboard entry flow (Enter key, focus preservation)

**Success Criteria:**
1. User can see final amount each person owes with expandable item breakdown
2. User can copy a plain text summary to clipboard
3. Keyboard-only data entry works (Tab flow, Enter to add new rows)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Integer cents for all money values (no floating point)
- Largest remainder method for fair penny distribution
- Simple full re-render pattern instead of granular DOM updates
- localStorage key 'splits-diners' for diner preset persistence
- Chip toggle pattern: filled/blue = assigned, outlined = not
- Native <details>/<summary> for expandable share breakdown
- Clipboard API with synchronous call in click handler (Safari compatibility)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Tab navigation fixed by deferring render() in change handlers
- UX improvements: removed number spinners, added Clear All button, duplicate dish button

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None significant
